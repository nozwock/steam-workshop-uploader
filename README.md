# Steam Workshop Uploader

It was primarily created to easily exclude files or folders from being uploaded.

You can use the `--glob` and `--ignore-file` options to specify files or folders to exclude (case-sensitive). By default, files and directories matching ignore patterns from files like `.ignore` and `.gitignore` are automatically excluded.

I resisted the urge to name it 'Yet Another Workshop Uploader'...

And, I'm not planning to have a GUI for now.

<sub><sup>Btw, don't tell me someone's already made one with the feature to exclude stuff? I couldn't find any when I needed it.</sup></sub>

### Unimplemented
- Setting language/locale for the items' title and description
- Predefined tags for items
- Item metadata
- Paid items for a Curated Workshop

## Creating a Workshop Item

You can create a workshop item using the following command:

```shell
workshop create --content 'path/to/workshop/content/folder' --app-id 0 # App ID of the game
```

Currently, all arguments for the `create` command are optional, and you will be prompted interactively for any required inputs.

To disable prompts for scripting purposes, use the `--no-prompt` flag.

To see all available options, use the `--help` flag.

## Updating a Workshop Item  

A file like the one below should be located in the root of the workshop item's content folder:  

##### `workshop.toml`  
```toml  
app_id = 0          # App ID of the game  
item_id = 0         # Workshop item ID  
tags = ["mytag"]    # Item tags  
```  

This file is automatically generated when a workshop item is created using this tool.

You can then update the item using the following command:

```shell
workshop update --content 'path/to/workshop/content/folder'
```

To see all available options, use the `--help` flag.

## Settings

The config file is located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/io.github.nozwock.steam-workshop-uploader/config.toml`.

You can disable the automatic opening of the workshop item page after creating or updating an item in the config file.
