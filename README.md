# Steam Workshop Uploader

I resisted the urge to name it 'Yet Another Workshop Uploader'...

And, I'm not planning to have a GUI for now.

<sub><sup>Btw, don't tell me someone's already made one with the feature to exclude stuff? I couldn't find any when I needed it.</sup></sub>

## Updating a Workshop Item  

A file like the one below should be located in the root of the workshop item's content folder:  

##### `workshop.toml`  
```toml  
app_id = 0          # App ID of your game  
item_id = 0         # Workshop item ID  
tags = ["mytag"]    # Item tags  
```  

This file is automatically generated when a workshop item is created using this tool.
